											<h2>Aboriginal Peoples</h2>			
										</header>
										<p>When Europeans explored Canada they found all regions occupied by native peoples they called Indians, because the first explorers thought they had reached the East Indies. The native people subsisted on the land in various ways, some by hunting and gathering, others by farming. The Huron-Wendat, like the Iroquois, were farmers and hunters in the Great Lakes region. The Northwest's Cree and Dene were hunters and gatherers. The Sioux were a nomadic people who followed the bison (buffalo) herds. Inuit subsisted entirely on Arctic wildlife. Fish were dried and smoked by West Coast natives to preserve them. As Aboriginal groups competed for land, resources, and prestige, they frequently engaged in warfare.</p>
										
										<P>The arrival of European traders, missionaries, soldiers, and colonists forever altered the indigenous way of life. Many Aboriginals died as a result of European diseases against which they lacked immunity. Nevertheless, during the first 200 years of coexistence, Aboriginals and Europeans formed strong economic, religious, and military bonds that laid the groundwork for Canada.</P>

											<h2>The First Europeans</h2>
										</header>
										<P>The Icelandic Vikings who colonised Greenland 1,000 years ago also reached Labrador and the island of Newfoundland. The ruins of their settlement, l'Anse aux Meadows, are designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site. The expedition of John Cabot, the first to draw a map of Canada's East Coast, kicked off European exploration in earnest in 1497. John Cabot, an Italian immigrant to England, was the first to map Canada's Atlantic coast, landing on Newfoundland or Cape Breton Island in 1497 and claiming it for England. It wasn't until 1610 that English settlers arrived.</P>

											<h2>Exploring a River, Naming Canada</h2>
										</header>
										<P>Jacques Cartier made three voyages across the Atlantic between 1534 and 1542, claiming the land for King Francis I of France. Cartier overheard two captured guides speak the Iroquoian word kanata, which translates as "village." The name Canada first appeared on maps in the 1550s.</P>

											<h2>Royal New France</h2>
										</header>
										<P>French explorers Pierre de Monts and Samuel de Champlain established the first European settlement north of Florida in 1604, first on St. Croix Island (in present-day Maine), then at Port-Royal, in Acadia (present-day Nova Scotia). Champlain constructed a fortress in what is now Québec City in 1608. The colonists had to contend with a harsh climate. Champlain allied the colony with the Algonquin, Montagnais, and Huron, who had long been enemies of the Iroquois, a confederation of five (later six) First Nations who had fought against the French settlements. In 1701 the French and the Iroquois reached an agreement.
											</P>
										<p>As Governor of Quebec, Sir Guy Carleton (Lord Dorchester) defended the rights of the Canadiens, defeated an American military invasion of Quebec in 1775, and supervised the Loyalist migration to Nova Scotia and Quebec in 1782-83.</p>

											<h2>Struggle for a Continent</h2>
										</header>
										<P>In 1670, King Charles II of England granted the Hudson's Bay Company exclusive trading rights over the Hudson Bay watershed. For the next 100 years, the Company competed with traders based in Montreal. The skilled and brave men who travelled by canoe were known as voyageurs and coureurs des bois, and they formed strong alliances with the First Nations.</P>
									    <P>Beginning in the early 1600s, English colonies along the Atlantic coast grew richer and more populous than New France. France and the United Kingdom fought for control of North America in the 1700s. The British defeated the French in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham in Québec City in 1759, effectively ending France's empire in America. Both armies' commanders, Brigadier James Wolfe and the Marquis de Montcalm, were killed while leading their troops into battle.</P>

											<h2>The Beginnings of Democracy</h2>
										</header>
										<P>Beginning in the early 1600s, English colonies along the Atlantic coast became more prosperous and populous than New France. In the 1700s, France and the United Kingdom fought for control of North America. In the Battle of the Plains of Abraham in Québec City in 1759, the British defeated the French, effectively ending France's empire in America. Brigadier James Wolfe and the Marquis de Montcalm, commanders of both armies, were killed while leading their troops into battle.</P>
									    <p>The Act also granted legislative assemblies elected by the people to the Canadas for the first time. At the same time, the name Canada became official and has been used ever since. British North America included the Atlantic colonies as well as the two Canadas.</p>

											<h2>Dominion from Sea to Sea
											</h2>
											
										</header>
										<p>Sir John Alexander Macdonald, a Confederation Father, became Canada's first Prime Minister in 1867. On January 11, 1815, he was born in Scotland and immigrated to Upper Canada as a child. He was a lawyer in Kingston, Ontario, as well as a gifted politician and a colourful character. The 11th of January has been designated as Sir John A. Macdonald Day by Parliament. His image appears on the $10 bill.
										</p>
										<p>From Quebec, Sir George-Étienne Cartier was a key architect of Confederation. Cartier, a railway lawyer, Montrealer, close ally of Macdonald, and patriotic Canadian, led Quebec into Confederation and assisted in negotiating the admission of the Northwest Territories, Manitoba, and British Columbia to Canada.</p>

											<h2>Canada’s First Prime Minister
											</h2>
											
										</header>
										<P>In 1864, Sir Leonard Tilley, a New Brunswick-born elected official and Father of Confederation, proposed the term Dominion of Canada. He was inspired by the Bible's Psalm 72, which speaks of "dominion from sea to sea and from the river to the ends of the earth." This phrase embodied the vision of constructing a powerful, united, prosperous, and free country spanning a continent. The title was incorporated into the Constitution, was used officially for approximately 100 years, and is still a part of our heritage today.</P>
