											<h2>Introduction</h2>			
										</header>
										<p>
											Canada is the first country that establishes institutional official multiculturalism. The Canadian Multiculturalism Act affirms the Government of Canada's policy of ensuring that each Canadian is treated fairly by a government that respects and celebrates diversity. The legislation also acknowledges and protects Canada's multicultural heritage. The purpose of Multiculturalism was to preserve every citizen's cultural liberty and also acknowledge the cultural achievements of diverse ethnic groups in Canadian society. The commission's recommendations were implemented as the government's official multiculturalism policy. The Multiculturalism Policy of Canada gives freedom to all individuals to practice their religions. That shows the strong commitment of the Canadian government to acknowledge and respect its diverse society

											<h2>Multiculturalism Act</h2>
										</header>
										<p>After the second world war, perceptions toward religious tolerance and
											independence in Canada began to change, particularly throughout the 1960s. To
											confront widespread religious intolerance and discrimination that persisted in the
											1960s, several levels of government implemented legal protections against
											"creed" discrimination. Trudeau becomes the first world leader to make
											multiculturalism an official policy. That puts Canada on the global stage. The 15th
											prime minister of Canada, Pierre Elliot Trudeau accepted the Multiculturalism
											policy (Altenburg, Jan 18: 7). "Multiculturalism Act is introduced in 1987 and
											enacted in 1988, following the formation of a Multiculturalism Committee (1985)
											and that Committee's report (1987)" (Altenburg, Jan 18: 8). The act aimed to
											eliminate any restrictions to full involvement in society and promised to
											encourage citizens in removing and overcoming discrimination. Intercultural
											exchange and communication were promoted to increase respect and knowledge
											of Canada's diversity. This is how Canada become the first country to implement a
											multiculturalism law at the national level. </p>

											<h2>A multifaith society</h2>
										</header>
										<P>Multiculturalism Policy allows citizens the freedom to practice their religious, faiths and maintain their identities without fear of government persecution in Canada. In other words, Canadian society encourages religious diversity as well as freedom. Every Canadian individual has the right to practice any religion they want if their activities do not violate the law. Even though there is no official national religion, Christianity has been the dominant faith since colonial times. "A most recent survey in Canada discovered that a narrow majority of Canadian citizens (55%) identify as Christian, with 29 percent being Catholic and 18 percent being Protestant ". "Approximately one-third of Canadians identify as atheists (8%), agnostics (5%), or nothing in particular (16%)". To be more precise, "According to Canadian census statistics, the proportion of Canadians who are religiously unaffiliated increased from 4% in 1971 to 24% in 2011". In addition, as a result of immigration, a growing proportion of Canadians identify with other religions such as Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Buddhism. Canadians would be more willing to accept various cultures and religions without any fear. Consequently, it creates a multifaith society where citizens have mutual respect and acceptance of one's own beliefs and faiths. From a recent survey, "more than half of all Canadians (55%) in the Center's 2018 survey said that religion is at least moderately important in their life, with over three-in-ten (29%) saying it is extremely important to them â€” a greater percentage than in the UK, France, and most other Western European nations". </P>

											<h2>Religious freedom and Immigration</h2>
										</header>
											<P>Religious freedom in Canada plays a significant role in Immigration. With the
												eagerness for a better material lifestyle for themselves and their children and
												families, more immigrants are likely to come to Canada because of their desire for
												religious freedom than for any other reason. According to The Economist,
												Canada's multiculturalism was indeed a strength that connected the various
												communities and was also an engine of economic progress by attracting
												immigrants from all over the globe. For example, "Since 2001, about four-in-ten
												(39%) new Canadian immigrants have belonged to religious minorities, the same
												as the share of new immigrants (also 39%) who identify as either Catholic or
												Protestant". However, there are some contemporary challenges to 
												the Multiculturalism Act. "A People's Party government will repeal the
												Multiculturalism Act and eliminate all funding to promote multiculturalism. We
												will instead emphasize the integration of immigrants into Canadian society, which
												is a statement made by Maxime Bernier on July 24, 2019" (This statement is also
												in the Party's Platform/website) (Altenburg, Jan 18: 24). This party received
												300,000 votes in the 2019 federal election and 800,000 votes in the 2021 federal
												election, however failed to win a seat (Altenburg, Jan 18: 25).</P>
